# This is a science outreach program designed for high school students. The original design was for a gingerbread house building stability competition for the Dr G.W. Williams S.S. science club; however the model can be used for any vibration simulation. There are multiple floor concept options, allowing for the inclusion of a foundation, safety walls, etc. The design was made to be accesibly made, and can be assembled with minimum tools (literally just the drill at most). The Scotch Yoke mechanism converts rotational motion to linear motion in one plane. 

# Students will learn about civil engineering principles, amplification, etc and gain an appreciation for the engineering process.

# The tools to create the model should be available in a high school/university shop: the floor is designed to be made from wood, and the yoke can milled fairly simply. To run the vibration machine, the only required tool is a drill (ideally variable speed but it doesn't really matter).
